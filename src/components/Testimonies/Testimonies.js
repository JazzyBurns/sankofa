            <p className="testimony-quote">“Participating in the Sankofa group was a very positive and rewarding experience for me. As an African American woman about to start her career in Psychology, it was eye-opening to see and hear the everyday struggles African American families go through. The stories and information I heard throughout my time in the group continue to motivate me to provide for families who have children with neurodevelopmental disorders. Everyone in the group was so kind and I left the group feeling like we were all family. There's such a genuine want and desire to help one another that it's contagious. I HIGHLY recommend that LEND trainees participate in this group!!”</p>
